# Riesz representation for the Universal Approximation Theorem

This file isolates the analytic input from duality theory used by the
Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) scaffold: every continuous linear
functional on `C(K, ℝ)` is represented by integration against a signed
(regular Borel) measure on `K`.

Mathlib provides the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani theorem for *positive* linear
functionals only. The *signed* / dual-space form `riesz_repr` is **proved**
here by combining the Riesz–Kantorovich decomposition
(`ForMathlib.RieszKantorovich.exists_positive_decomposition`, which splits a
continuous functional into two cone-positive functionals) with the positive
Riesz–Markov–Kakutani theorem applied to each part.

on each order interval `[0, f]` its values are bounded above by `‖L‖ * ‖f‖`. This is the
bridge feeding `C(↥K, ℝ)` into the abstract Riesz–Kantorovich decomposition. -/
