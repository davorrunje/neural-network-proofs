/-- **PROVED.** A subspace `V` of `C(K, ℝ)` is dense (its topological closure is
everything) iff every continuous linear functional vanishing on `V` is the zero
functional. This is the Hahn–Banach reduction underlying the UAT proof.

The forward direction uses continuity of `L`: it vanishes on `V`, hence on the
closure of `V`, which is everything. The backward direction is the contrapositive:
if `V` is not dense, pick a point `x` outside the closed convex set
`V.topologicalClosure` and apply geometric Hahn–Banach
(`geometric_hahn_banach_point_closed`) to obtain a continuous functional `f`
separating `x` from the closure. A linear functional bounded below on the subspace
`V` must vanish on `V`, so `f` is a nonzero functional vanishing on `V`,
contradicting the right-hand side. -/

/-- **Universal Approximation Theorem** (Cybenko, scaffold). The single-hidden-layer
family with a continuous sigmoidal activation is dense in `C(K, ℝ)`.

Proof: reduce density to "every continuous functional vanishing on the family is
zero" via `dense_iff_forall_functional_eq_zero`. Represent such a functional `L`
by a signed measure `μ` (`riesz_repr`). Since every generator lies in the family,
`L` vanishes on all generators, i.e. `μ` annihilates every `x ↦ σ(⟪w,x⟫ + b)`. By
`sigmoidal_discriminatory`, `μ = 0`, hence `L = 0`. -/

/-- **ε-form corollary.** Every continuous function on the compact set `K` can be
approximated to arbitrary precision in the sup-norm by an element of the
single-hidden-layer family.

(The `[CompactSpace ↥K]` instance is needed so that the sup-norm `‖·‖` on
`C(↥K, ℝ)` is available in the statement; it is implied by `hK` and is supplied
automatically at every call site via `isCompact_iff_compactSpace`.) -/
