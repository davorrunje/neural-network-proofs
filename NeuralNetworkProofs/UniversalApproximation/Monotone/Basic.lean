# General lemmas for the monotone-network development

Three model-independent lemmas extracted from the monotone neural-network development so that the
domination, approximation, and interpolation files can share a single proof instead of carrying
inline copies.

* `sum_le_one_card_le_iff` — for a `Fintype ι` and `g : ι → ℝ` with each `g i ≤ 1`, the sum reaches
  the cardinality iff every summand equals `1`.  (Generalizes the threshold-sum bound in the
  domination gadget.)
* `dist_le_of_coord` — a per-coordinate bound on `Fin d → ℝ` transfers to a sup-metric `dist`
  bound.  (Used to turn grid gaps into distance bounds in the approximation proof.)
* `sort_key_linear_extension` — sorting indices by the lexicographic key
  `fun i => (a i, toLinearExtension (b i))` yields a permutation that linearly extends the
  coordinatewise order on the sorted points.  (Generalizes the reindexing lemma of the
  interpolation proof.)

/-- If every summand `g i` of a finite family of reals is at most `1`, then the sum is at least the
cardinality of the index type exactly when every summand equals `1`.  Forward: any summand strictly
below `1` makes the sum strictly below the cardinality; backward: all summands equal to `1` sum to
the cardinality. -/

/-- If two points of `Fin d → ℝ` agree per coordinate to within `c ≥ 0`, then their sup-metric
distance is at most `c`.  The distance on `Fin d → ℝ` is the sup metric, so this is `dist_pi_le_iff`
combined with `Real.dist_eq`. -/

/-- Sorting the indices by the lexicographic key `fun i => (a i, toLinearExtension (b i))` produces
a permutation that linearly extends the partial order on the sorted points.

Given a family of points `b : ι → β` in a partial order and real targets `a : ι → ℝ` that are
monotone along `b` (`b i ≤ b j → a i ≤ a j`) with `b` injective, `Tuple.sort` of the key yields a
permutation `π` such that comparability of the sorted points, `b (π s) ≤ b (π t)`, forces the index
order `s ≤ t`.  The `LinearExtension` second component makes the key injective, so equal keys force
equal points and hence equal indices; monotonicity of the sort then pins down the order. -/
