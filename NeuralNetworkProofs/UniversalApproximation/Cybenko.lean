# Universal Approximation Theorem (Cybenko) — scaffold root

This is the root module of a Lean 4 + Mathlib scaffold for Cybenko's
**Universal Approximation Theorem** (UAT): the single-hidden-layer neural
network family built from a continuous *sigmoidal* activation is dense in the
space `C(K, ℝ)` of continuous real-valued functions on a compact set
`K ⊆ EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.

It re-exports the five component modules:

* `Activation` — `Sigmoidal`, `signedIntegral`, and `Discriminatory`.
* `Discriminatory` — the proved `sigmoidal_discriminatory` (Cybenko's
  Fourier/measure argument).
* `Network` — `Layer`, `Network`, and `Layer.continuous_toFun`.
* `Family` — `generator`, the spanned submodule `S`, and `generator_mem_S`.
* `Riesz` — the proved dual/signed Riesz representation `riesz_repr` (via
  `ForMathlib.RieszKantorovich` + positive Riesz–Markov–Kakutani).
* `Theorem` — the Hahn–Banach reduction
  `dense_iff_forall_functional_eq_zero`, the main theorem
  `universal_approximation`, and the ε-form corollary
  `universal_approximation_eps`.

## Status: fully proved

The development is now **`sorry`-free**. Both formerly-admitted analytic facts
are proved:

1. `UniversalApproximation.Cybenko.sigmoidal_discriminatory` — a continuous sigmoidal
   activation is discriminatory (Cybenko's Fourier/measure half-space argument),
   in `Discriminatory.lean`.
2. `UniversalApproximation.Cybenko.riesz_repr` — the signed / dual Riesz representation,
   via the Riesz–Kantorovich decomposition (`ForMathlib.RieszKantorovich`) plus the
   positive Riesz–Markov–Kakutani theorem.

The structural pieces are likewise proved:

* continuity of layers / networks (`Layer.continuous_toFun`);
* the spanned subspace and its generators (`S`, `generator`,
  `generator_mem_S`);
* the Hahn–Banach reduction of density to functional vanishing
  (`dense_iff_forall_functional_eq_zero`);
* the headline theorem `universal_approximation`;
* the ε-corollary `universal_approximation_eps`.

The sanity lemma `logistic_sigmoidal` below — that the standard logistic
function `t ↦ 1 / (1 + exp (-t))` is sigmoidal — is **fully proved** (it is
*not* a third admit), exhibiting a concrete activation satisfying the
`Sigmoidal` hypothesis of the main theorem.

/-- **PROVED (sanity check).** The standard logistic function
`t ↦ 1 / (1 + exp (-t))` is `Sigmoidal`: it is continuous (the denominator
`1 + exp (-t) ≥ 1 > 0` never vanishes), tends to `0` as `t → -∞` (then
`exp (-t) → +∞`, so the reciprocal `→ 0`), and tends to `1` as `t → +∞` (then
`exp (-t) → 0`, so `1 / (1 + exp (-t)) → 1 / 1 = 1`).

This provides a concrete witness for the `Sigmoidal` hypothesis of
`universal_approximation`. -/
